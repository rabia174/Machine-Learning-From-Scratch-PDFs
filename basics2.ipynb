After Python has started your program, the command line parameters are visible as follows. The name of the program is in `sys.argv[0]`. The rest of the command line parameters are after the program name in this list: `sys.argv[1]==\"param1\"`, `sys.argv[2]==\"param2\"`, and so on. The command line parameters can be useful in adjusting the behaviour of your program. A few examples of these will be in the following exercises.
